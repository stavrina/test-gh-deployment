# Welcome to the Royce Institute Data Handbook

We've written this to share resources that we find useful to (research) data management practices, and to host our user guides.  
<br>
The content is written and managed by the {{ data_curators }} based at the {{ royce_institute }} Manchester Hub.  
<br>
We're proudly powered by {{ jupyter_book }} and {{ executable_books }}.  
<br>
This book isn't meant to be read page-to-page or in the sequence presented in the sidebar.  
We suggest starting out with a topic from the sidebar that interests you.  
<br>
Some of the most useful materials will be found under the **Research Data Management** section and the **[Utilities](bib-util/useful-interesting.md)** article.  
<br>
:::{note}
Some of the content in this book are training materials for our team, so while not directly relevant they might be useful to some, or if you're interested in contributing.
