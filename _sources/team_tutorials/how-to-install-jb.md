# Get Anaconda
At the time of writing this, the Jupyter Book package has been tested with [Python 3.7 on Windows 10](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/advanced/windows.html)[^note-on-lsw], with the latest Python version being 3.10.  
We will use Anaconda as our package manager to specify which version of Python we want to run on.

## Download Anaconda

[^note-on-lsw]: Of course you can bypass most of this guide and use the Linux Subsystem on Windows and if you prefer `pip` as your package and virtual environment manager.
[^safari]: We are not able to test this on the Safari web browser, currently. If you are able to help feel free to contribute to this guide.
